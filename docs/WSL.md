## Increase the limiting Memory Usage in WSL2

1. Check the current memory
You can check how much memory and swap space are allocated to WSL using the free command from within a WSL distribution:
```
free -h --giga
```

2. Create .wslconfig
Refer to the Microsoft docs on configuration settings for **.wslconfig** if you need help with this step. Below is the config that Iâ€™m currently using for my machine since I don't have a lot of RAM to work with:

"C:\Users\YourUsername\.wslconfig"
```
[wsl2]
memory=100GB
```

3. Restart WSL
You can either close out of WSL manually and wait a few seconds for it to fully shut down, or you could launch Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following command to forcibly shut down all WSL distributions:
```
wsl --shutdown
```
4. Verify That WSL Respects .wslconfig
Finally, run the free command again to verify that WSL respects your specified resource limits:
```
free -h --giga
```
